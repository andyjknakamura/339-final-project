        <h1>Layout Design</h1>
        <p>For about a year, I worked as a graphic designer for SHEI Magazine, the University of Michigan's most popular fashion publication. I was tasked with creating 2-6 page spreads of either written content or photoshoots, and I was given a lot of freedom to be creative with how I wanted to lay out each page. Below are a few of my favorite spreads that I've designed for SHEI.</p>

    <main id = "main" class="container">
        <img src="images/Addiction-Nakamura-FirstDraft1.jpg" alt="First spread for the photoshoot 'Addiction' featuring a large group photo of all the models together">
        <img src="images/Addiction-Nakamura-FirstDraft.jpg" alt="Second spread for the photoshoot 'Addiction' featuring a photos of the individual and and groups of models laid on top of a large group photo of all the models' hands">
        <p id='text'>This layout was for the photoshoot "Addiction," and I immediately fell in love with the colors and the mixing of different textures of the backgrounds when I saw the photos. I decided to play up the psychadelic nature of the photos by creating text in illustrator and creating motions blurs in photoshop. I also sourced colors from the images to create semi-transparent borders overlaying the photos.</p>
        <img src="images/Grass_Nakamura_FirstDraft.jpg" alt="First spread for the photoshoot 'The Grass is Always Greener' featuring a MacOS Desktop display with all the photos from the shoot as shortcut icons and an iMessage window open with the main image sent as an attachment">
        <img src="images/Grass_Nakamura_FirstDraft2.jpg" alt="Second spread for the photoshoot 'The Grass is Always Greener' featuring another MacOS Desktop display with a few images open on top of a background image that was another photo from the shoot">
        <p id='text'>This is my favorite layout that I've done because I had a really strong vision for the design from the outset. Several images I received from the photograph contained photoshopped iMessages overlayed on the photos, so I decided to design the pages around a desktop homepage. I even included small details like including the staff credits inside of the iMessage client.</p>
        <img src="images/ReflectionsAndRefractions-Nakamura-FirstDraft.jpg" alt="Spread for the written article 'Reflections and Refractions'">
        <img src="images/sheiDesignApp.jpg" alt="Spread for the written article 'Fashion for Every Body'">
        <p id='text'>Both of these layouts were for written works, which I can often find challenging because the page must be interesting enough to capture the reader's attention while still ensuring that the text is readable. I achieve this balance by styling the title to grab the reader's attention and filling white space with different design elements and colors. It is also easy to find inspiration in the written text of the story, so that typically guides my design process.</p>
        <img src="images/LostinTime-Nakamura-FirstDraft.jpg" alt="First spread for the photoshoot 'Lost in Time' featuring a large background photo of a women running up a street">
        <img src="images/LostinTime-Nakamura-FirstDraft2.jpg" alt="Second spread for the photoshoot 'Lost in Time' featuring a collage of photos from the shoot">
        <img src="images/LostinTime-Nakamura-FirstDraft3.jpg" id='finalimg' alt="Third spread for the photoshoot 'Lost in Time' featuring a collage of photos from the shoot">
        <p id='text' class="finaltext">This spread is the longest one I've designed because it contained both a story and photos. Because of the title "Lost in Time," I wanted to create a collage to channel that feelings of being lost. I wanted the photos to cut into one another so that the viewer can see the collision of these worlds that the photgrapher has created.</p>
