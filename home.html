        <p id="intro">Hi, my name is Andrew Nakamura! <br> <br> Welcome to my website! I took inspiration from the Windows XP engine, because it was created and released just one year before I was born, and the idea of retro-technology is interesting to me because technological advancement is so heavily associated with a distant future, but my generation has a significant amount of nostalgia for these modern inventions. I aim for this website to bridge the past, present, and future; it displays work from the past year of my life, will be used for job applications in the future, and of course, is the project I am presently creating. <br> <br> The other two tabs of this website will bring you to my layout design work from my time as a graphic designer for a magazine and my writing from my time as a columnist/editor for a newspaper, respectively. This page serves as a brief introduction to the website, and also you can find more information about me below. I hope to add many more features to this website in the future <br> <br> Thank you for stopping by!</p>
