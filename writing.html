            <h1>Writing</h1>
            <p>I worked as a columnist and editor for the Michigan Daily for about a year and a half, and in my time there I have written 128 articles and designed accompanying graphics for all but one of them. Below are the images and excerpts from nine of my favorite works, along with links to the full article for each.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/michigan-in-color/demystifying-the-horoscope-writing-process/">Demystifying the horoscope writing process</a></h2>
                <p>I ran the Michigan Daily's horoscope column for nearly a year, and my editor suggested that I write an article detailing exactly what goes into writing the horoscopes. This article reveals all the resources and processes that I used to churn out content on a regular basis.</p>

                <p>I wrote this article for a Valentine's Day series my section was publishing. It focuses on the ways in which love can be especially complex for queer people, how we cope with that difficulty, and what happens when the unavoidable truth is painful.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/michigan-in-color/defying-toxic-masculinity-manhood/">Defying manhood</a></h2>
                <p>This article discusses the history of how some marginalized identities have been historically excluded from manhood, and how we can find empowerment in deviation from these strict norms. I enjoyed writing this article because I was able to experiment with figurative language in ways I hadn't before.</p>

                <p>I love exploring literary technique in video games because their interactive component can often bring interesting elements to the shaping of their narratives. This article hones in on the exceptionally brilliant usage of these elements to instill shock and horror in the first hour of the game "Omori."</p>

                <p>I was inspired to write this piece while I was home for the summer and looking back through old yearbooks, when I saw a photo of myself from several years ago that I barely recognized. My style has a lot since then, and I decided to write about how I was able to develop more self-confidence through fashion.</p>

                <p>I had always been kind of perplexed by the common saying "If you can't love yourself, how will you love someone else?" This article dissects that phrase and others like it and offers a new interpretation inspired by american singer Lizzo.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/michigan-in-color/beyond-face-value-artificial-intelligence-racism/">Beyond face value</a></h2>
                <p>The perpetuation of oppressive structures in technology is a critical issue that is often ignored. This article discusses the ways in which racial biases affects how technology is developed and the social pressures that even seemingly innocuous machines can reinforce.</p>

                <p>My horoscope column was consistently popular among the readers of the Michigan Daily, and I am glad that my inane ramblings about the stars had touched so many people. This was the last horoscope I wrote for the Daily before I left the staff.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/michigan-in-color/preemptive-grieving/">Preemptive grieving</a></h2>
                <p>I wrote this article a few months after I attended a funeral for a family member who had passed away while I was away from home at college. The piece explores the feelings behind a lack of outward expressions of grief, regret for what is now unknowable, and the truth we tactfully omit to maintain each other's happiness</p>
